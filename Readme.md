# Welcome!
This is the official space for two initiatives currently organised by member of the [Machine Readable Nature Research Group](https://www.nhm.uio.no/english/research/groups/mana/index.html) - [Erik Kusch](https://www.nhm.uio.no/english/about/organization/research-collections/people/erikkus/index.html). Here, you can (1) submit your woes in computational and quantitative research you are dealing with in your research at the [Natural History Museum (NHM) of the University of Oslo (UiO)](https://www.nhm.uio.no/english/) and (2) keep up-to-date with workshops organised for anyone at NHM who is interested in all things coding, machine readability, data handling, and analysis.

## NHM Computational Helpdesk
The NHM Computational Helpdesk is a place at which you may seek help with theory, scripting, implementation, and interpretation of data pipelines and statistical analyses. This help is rendered through a community effort of colleagues at NHM and so lives and dies by the involvement of experienced as well as novel quantitative ecologists and data scientists. 

To submit an inquiry for help, please go to the [Issues Tab](https://github.com/uio-mana/Helpdesk/issues) and thereafter submitting a new issue as a [Helpdesk Inquiry](https://github.com/uio-mana/Helpdesk/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&projects=&template=helpdesk-inquiry.md&title=) template.

Lastly, please be cognisant of this being a voluntary activity on the side of the helpdesk folk so timespans until you receive a reply to your submitted issue may vary. In addition to registering your issues here on GitHub, we also strongly recommend joining the in-person helpdesk events held as described in the [physical helpdesk schedule](https://github.com/uio-mana/Helpdesk/issues/1).

## Coders & Biostatisticans of NHM
The Coders & Biostatisticians of NHM is a recurring workshop format at which presenters (who are strongly encouraged to volunteer) prepare and guide attendees through the basiscs and advanced considerations of code management, etiquette, curation, and dissemination as well as theory and practical aspects of statistical analyses.
